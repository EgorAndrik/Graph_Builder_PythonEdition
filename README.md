**This is an application for plotting mathematical graphs of functions.**
## **Peculiarity**
* **This application is based on the past, that is, instead of suffering from the server, I decided to write the application completely in one language. The previous application ([link](https://github.com/EgorAndrik/Graph_Builder/tree/newmain)) I will maintain and update anyway.**
